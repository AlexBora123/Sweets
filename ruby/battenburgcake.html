  <h3><em>This fancy almond-flavored tea cake, also called 'Battenberg/Battenburg Cake' or 'Battenberg/Battenburg Square' features a homemade marzipan.</em></h3>
  <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 cup butter, softened</li>
    <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
    <li>3 eggs</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
    <li>⅛ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>2 drops red food coloring</li>
    <li>1 cup apricot preserves</li>
    <li>2 cups ground almonds</li>
    <li>3 cups confectioners' sugar</li>
    <li>1 egg, room temperature</li>
    <li>1 ½ teaspoons lemon juice</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon almond extract</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li><p>Cream butter and 1 cup sugar together. Beat in 3 eggs, one at a time.</p><p>Mix in vanilla. Stir in flour, baking powder and salt gently. Add milk if needed.</p></li>
    <li><p>Divide batter into 2 equal parts. Add food coloring to 1 part to make a deep pink color.</p><p> Grease two 7 inch square pans. Spread batters into pans.</p></li>
    <li><p>Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) until an inserted wooden pick comes out clean,</p> <p>about 25 to 30 minutes. Let stand in pans 5 minutes. Turn out on racks to cool.</p></li>
    <li><p>Trim edges from both cakes. Cut each cake lengthwise into 4 strips as wide as the </p><p>cake is thick. Trim to make strips match. Heat jam slightly. Spread on sides to glue 2 </p><p>pink and 2 white strips together checkerboard fashion. Spread all 4 sides of </p><p>completed cake with jam. Repeat with remaining pink and white stripes. Makes two cakes.</p></li>
    <li><p>To Make Almond Paste: Mix almonds, confectioners' sugar, egg, lemon juice, </p><p>and almond extract together. Knead until smooth, adding a bit of lemon juice or water if</p><p> too dry to roll. Add only 1/2 teaspoon at a time. It will be stiff. Divide into 2 equal parts.</p></li>
    <li><p>Roll 1/2 of paste 1/8 inch or so thick on a surface lightly dusted with confectioners'</p><p> sugar. Cut to fit length of cake, and long enough to cover 4 sides leaving ends </p><p>uncovered. Lay cake on one end of paste. Wrap to completely enclose all 4 sides of </p><p>cake pinching paste to seal. Roll in granulated sugar. Place with seal underneath on </p><p>serving plate, or store in plastic bag. Repeat for second cake. Chill. Slice thinly to serve.</p></li>
